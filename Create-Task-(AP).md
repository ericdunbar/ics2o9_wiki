## GENERAL INFORMATION

Name: Create Task (programming)

Time: 10 class periods

Weighting: 26% of AP Grade.  Parts of this task will also be used for your ICS2O summative task.

Further Description: [here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles)

## TASK

1. Develop a program:
On a topic that interests you _or_ that solves a problem.

2. Submit a video of your program running (shows at least a main feature)
3. Submit written responses based on your program
4. Submit code

You may work with a partner on the code, but the rest of the submission must be individual.  

The video, written responses and code will be submitted to AP.

## PROGRAM

Your program should:

* Draw upon mathematical and logical concepts, such as the use of numbers, variables, mathematical expressions with arithmetic operators, logical and Boolean operators and expressions, decision statements (IF), iteration (loops) and/or collections (lists).
* Implement an algorithm that integrates two or more algorithms and mathematical and/or logical concepts
* Use abstractions to manage the complexity of your program (functions, abstractions provided by programming language etc)

## WRITTEN RESPONSES

You are given a mark if you answer the question appropriately, no partial credit.  Each response has a maximum number of words.  

Sample responses are available [at the bottom of this page.](https://apcentral-stg.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam?course=ap-computer-science-principles)

You are strongly encouraged to submit your written responses using the template found on the AP site.

2a. Provide a written response or audio narration in your video that:
* Identifies the programming language
* Identifies the purpose of your program
* Explains what the video illustrates
	
(Must not exceed 150 words)

2b. Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated.  In your description clearly indicate whether the development described was collaborative or independent.  At least one of these points must refer to independent program development.

(Must not exceed 200 words)

2c. Capture and paste a program code segment that implements an algorithm (marked with an oval in code) and that is fundamental for your program to achieve its intended purpose.  This code segment must be an algorithm you developed individually on your own, must include two or more algorithms, and must integrate mathematical and/or logical concepts.  Describe how each algorithm within your selected algorithm functions independently, as well as in combination with other, to form a new algorithm that helps to achieve the intended purpose of the program.

(Must not exceed 200 words)

2d. Capture and paste a program code segment that contains an abstraction you developed individually on your own (marked with a rectangle in code).  This abstraction must integrate mathematical and logical concepts.  Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program.

(Must not exceed 200 words)

3. You will capture and paste your entire program code into your submission.
* An oval marks the section containing your algorithm
* A rectangle marks the section containing your abstraction
* Include comments or acknowledgements for program code that has been written by someone else.

## OTHER INFO

Please refer to the document for additional information, particularly the “Guidelines Section” that contains things you must, may or may not do.

Your code will be used for your ICS 2O programming summative assignment (check criteria).
