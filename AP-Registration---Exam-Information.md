# WHY TAKE THE EXAM?

To get university credit!  Each university has different rules for giving credit for AP courses.  I recommend you do some research, keeping in mind your future plans/school choice.  

You can Google “AP Transfer Credit (school name)” to find a particular school’s rules surrounding this course (**Computer Science Principles**).

For example, [Waterloo gives credit](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/admissions/ap-transfer-credit) for this course _except_ for students in the Faculty of Mathematics (Math, Statistics, Computer Science).  You must also achieve a score of 4 or 5 in the course (approximately 75%+).
