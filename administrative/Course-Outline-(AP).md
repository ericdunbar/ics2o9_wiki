## Course Description
The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed to be equivalent to a first-semester introductory college computing course.  In this course, students will develop computational thinking skills vital for success across all disciplines, such as using computational tools to analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from trends.  The course engages students in the creative aspects of the field by allowing them to develop computational artifacts based on their interests.  Students will also develop effective communication and collaboration skills by working individually and collaboratively to solve problems, and will discuss and write about the impacts these solutions could have on their community, society, and the world.

## Big Ideas
The course is organized around seven _Big Ideas_, which encompass ideas foundational to studying computer science.  These Big Ideas are:
1. Creativity
2. Abstraction
3. Data and Information
4. Algorithms
5. Programming
6. The Internet
7. Global Impact

## Assessment and Evaluations
AP Computer Science Principles evaluation consists of two Performance Tasks and one Final Exam.
* Performance Task: Explore (16%)
* Performance Task: Create (24%)
* Final Exam (60%)

The Performance Tasks will be completed during class time, and the Final Exam will take place sometime in May.  More information will be posted on the website.
