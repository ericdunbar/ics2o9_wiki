### Hardware
H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9.  
* Describe the basic functionality of your piece of hardware.
* What makes a good <*insert name of hardware piece here*> ?  What should you look for when buying one? What if you are on a budget?

H10.  
* Describe each piece of terminology given (any others would be good as well)
* What makes something _better_ based on the terminology?

H11.  
* Describe what a Raspberry Pi is.
* Why would someone purchase a Raspberry Pi?
* What use do they have? What does the future look like for them?

### Operating Systems
O1  
* Describe how an operating system works
* Describe and display how an operating system connects to hardware

O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7  
* Describe your operating system
* Who is your operating system built for?
* Why would someone choose your operating system?

O8  
* Describe the operating system
* Compare your operating system with the other ones that are in your section
* Give an **unbiased** review of the pros and cons of each of the operating systems

O9  
* Describe the differences between the 3 types of software
* Describe why they are all important to computer usage

O10  
* Demonstrate how to copy, paste, move, delete files, and create shortcuts within the Windows operating system.
* Show how to properly organize files, including file names, folder names, etc.

O11
* Describe maintenance techniques such as defragging and disk clean up, and why it's important to do so.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

This is the research and report/share portion of the assignment connecting to the [next assignment](./Hardware-Network-OS-Applying-Your-Knowledge)

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Computer Systems_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to describe hardware [and software] components and assess usersâ€™ needs thereof.

| Success Criteria | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can use correct terminology to describe computer hardware, speed measurements, and size measurements | | | |
| I can describe the functions of the internal, network, and/or peripheral components of a computer | | | |
