## Task(s)

1. Individually or in pairs, you will be putting together a proposal package for a potential client as below.  There will be a roughly equal number of individuals/groups for each Client.

_Your teacher might set up this differently - see your teacher for more details_

## Clients

### Client 1
> Hello! I am looking for some help with regards to my computing needs at the office.  I will need one computer for myself, and there will be contractors that come in and will be using their own laptops.  They will need connectivity to the network printer while they are in the building.  
>
> For our computer, our needs are as follows:
> * We need the fastest, most graphically powerful computer that you can create for us.
> * We need a lot of space on the computer, and an external hard drive would also prove useful.
> * We will require a Wacom tablet for artwork.
> * We like consistency and prefer Windows, but if we were to take on Linux, it would have to be a user-friendly distribution.
> * We need a new network printer, just something to print off black and white copies of our work, as we get our colour prints done professionally off-site.
>
> We create Game Art Design (designing characters, settings etc) for a local game creation company (Client #2), so we will need to be able share files and chat with them easily.  Do you have any suggestions?


### Client 2
> Hi!
>
> I am cheap... super cheap.  I need a computer that is powerful enough to play the newest games, but I only need to run Linux.  We love tinkering with programs, so we are okay with setting things up on Linux.
>
> As a computer programmer, myself and my colleagues in the office will need the best network system and connectivity that you can set up for us.  We need to be able to share files and chat with our artists (Client #1), but also amongst ourselves (anything you can suggest for programmers would be great).
>
> The programs we tend to make are highly graphically intensive, and are going to be taking up a lot of space. We will also need a network storage system (NAS) to hold on to all of the assets that we are getting created for us by our artists (Client #1).
>
> We also tend to prefer mechanical keyboards, and a mouse with many button options so that we can set up macros to speed up our work.

### Client 3
> Greetings.
>
> I am a realtor, looking for someone to upgrade my computer setup.  I work out of my home office but am frequently out on the road.      
>
> For a desktop computer, I don't do much beyond word processing, spreadsheets, internet browsing and some light graphic design (brochures).  I would love to have a dual-screen setup, so I can refer to documents on one screen while working on another.  I also need a network setup for the whole house (approximately 2500 squared feet) that my family can use, color printer and the ability to share small PDF files with colleagues and clients. 
>
> When I am out of the house I need some sort of portable computer to do the same things, except for the graphic design.  It would be handy to allow my clients to sign documents digitally, without having to print documents on the go.  A decent digital camera would be helpful for taking photos of my listings.
>
> I'd prefer not to spend too much on all of this, but I'm willing to go higher if you can convince me that it's worth it.


## Task Criteria (Package)

### Section 1 (Title Page)  
A title page (1 page) including:
* Your name,
* the course code,
* a title for your work,
* which client you were assigned,

### Section 2 (Table of Contents)  
A table of contents (1-2 pages), complete this at the end after you have completed every other section.

### Section 3 (Abstract)  
An abstract about the paperwork in the next few pages.  This is usually a summary of what is included in the entire package, including a basic conclusion on decisions made - **do this last**.

### Section 4 (Proposed System)  
This section will be the largest of all sections, and will include:
* A paragraph describing the client's needs in your own words followed by,
* A table (or tables) that shows the computer hardware (individual components) and specialty item choices. Include part type, product name, where you plan to buy the item and price (1-3 pages).  [PCPartPicker](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/) is an excellent resource.
* Include hyperlinks for your prices.  If you are unsure of how to add a hyperlink, a short lesson will be available for you.

### Section 5 (Networking)
This is a written section that includes:
* A paragraph describing the client's needs in your own words followed by,
* A table of required hardware and networking applications (such as for file sharing or communication), similar to Section 4.

### Section 6 (Software and Operating Systems)
This is a written and visual section as follows:
* Describe which Operating System and applications (non-networking) the client could possibly need.  Include current pricing (hyperlink the price to your source).
* Describe briefly what preventative maintenance (steps they should take to ensure the smooth operation of their computer) the client should use.
* Describe a folder structure that you could suggest to the client.  Feel free to include a visual of this if you find it easier.

### Section 7 (Reasoning)  
This section will include reasoning behind your choices in _Section 4_, _Section 5_, and _Section 6_.

### Section 8 (Reflection)
This section will be a written reflection answering the following questions:
* What was the most difficult part of completing this project?
* What did you learn from completing this project?
* Would you have preferred to complete this project for another _Client_? Why or why not?

### Section 9 (Sources)
* Cite any of your sources here using either APA, MLA, or Chicago Style formatting.

### Important notes
* All pages should have a page number at the bottom, excluding the first page.
* For _Section 4_ you have to purchase individual parts, and **not** all-in-one solutions.
* **DO NOT PRINT THIS WORK** - See the submission information below for more details.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

This is the application of the knowledge learned/researched from the [previous assignment](./Hardware-Network-OS-Research-and-Report).

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Computer Systems_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to describe hardware [and software] components and assess usersâ€™ needs thereof.
  * We are learning to use software products and operating system software.

| Success Criteria | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can assess user computing needs and select appropriate software for different situations  | | | |
| I can describe the features and limitations of various operating systems functions that meet diverse user needs | | | |
| I can assess user computing needs and select appropriate hardware and networking components for different situations | | | |
| I can explain the importance of system maintenance to manage the performance and increase the security of a computer. | | | |
