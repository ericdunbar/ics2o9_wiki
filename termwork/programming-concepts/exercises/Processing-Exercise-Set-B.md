# Exercise Set (B)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 3 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 2](./Processing-Assignment-2)

## Exercise 5
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Recreate the image below.  Each set of shapes is created with ```for``` loops.  For example, there is only one ```triangle``` line of code, but the ```for``` loop draws multiple triangles.

## Exercise 6
_Estimated time to complete: 1-3 classes_

1. Recreate the image below. Use ```while``` loops to complete this task.  You can technically complete this task using ```for``` loops, but it is expected that you practice using ```while``` loops.

## Exercise 7
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Recreate [this image](https://imgur.com/QRgdwMj).  Use a single ```FloatList``` to complete this task.  Trees are added one at a time with a right mouse click, and taken away one at a time with a left mouse click.

## Exercise 8
_Estimated time to complete: 1-2 classes_

1. Make a copy of Assignment 1.  Organize your code using functions, rather than having everything in the ```draw()``` function.  For example you can have functions to draw certain parts of your sketch, or to perform certain checks.



## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.
