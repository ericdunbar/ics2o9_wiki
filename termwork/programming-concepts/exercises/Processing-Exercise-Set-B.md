# Exercise Set (B) - ADDITIONAL EXERCISES TO BE ADDED

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 3 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 2](./Processing-Assignment-2)

## Exercise 5
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Recreate the image below.  Each set of shapes is created with ```for``` loops.  For example, there is only one ```triangle``` line of code, but the ```for``` loop draws multiple triangles.

## Exercise 6
_Estimated time to complete: 1-3 classes_

1. Recreate the image below. Use ```while``` loops to complete this task.  You can technically complete this task using ```for``` loops, but it is expected that you practice using ```while``` loops.

## Bonus Exercise
_Estimated time to complete: 2-4 classes_

1. Work on this if you complete Exercise 7 early.
2. Recreate the image below.  You will need to make use of the ```%``` operator, and ```while``` loops.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.
