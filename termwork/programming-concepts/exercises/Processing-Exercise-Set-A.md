# Exercise Set (A)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 5 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 1](./Processing-Assignment-1)

## Exercise 1
_Estimated time to complete: 3-4 classes_

1. Using your knowledge of Processing so far, recreate the [image below](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise1_2O.png). Use can use color, strokeWeight, strokeJoin, fill, etc. to **enhance** the picture if you wish.

## Exercise 2a
_Estimated time to complete: 1 class_

1. Recreate the [image below](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise3_2O.gif). The circles should be created as you move your mouse.

## Exercise 2b
_Estimated time to complete: 1 class_

1. Recreate the [image below](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise3b_2O.gif). The circles should show up in a random space with a random colour.

## Bonus Exercise
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Work on this exercise if you finish Exercise 1 and 2 early.  
2. Using your knowledge of Processing so far, recreate the [image below](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise2_2O.png). Use a screen size of at least 640 pixels wide, and you should be using **only** the arc() function (and ellipse() for the little dots)

## Exercise 3
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Recreate the [image below](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise4_2O.gif). You will need to use variables to complete this example.

![Ex4](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise4_2O.gif).


## Exercise 4
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Recreate this [image](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise5_2O.gif). You will need variables and if statements to complete this example.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.


| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can use correct terminology to describe programming concepts | | | |
| I can describe the types of data that computers can process and store (Exercise 3, 4) | | | |
| I can explain the difference between constants and variables used in programming (Exercise 3, 4) | | | |
| I can determine the expressions and instructions to use in a programming statement, taking into account the order of operations (Exercise 2, 3, 4) | | | |
| I can identify situations in which decision structures are required | | | |
| I can appropriately use decision structures | | | |
| I can describe the function of Boolean, comparison, and arithmetic operators | | | |


| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can use variables, expressions, and assignment statements to store and manipulate numbers and text in a program (Exercise 2, 3, 4) | | | |
| I can write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards | | | |
| I can write a program that includes input and output (Exercise 2a) | | | |
| I can write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards | | | |
