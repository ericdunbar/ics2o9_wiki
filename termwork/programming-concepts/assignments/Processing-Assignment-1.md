_Your teacher might have a different task for you to complete.  Please see your teacher for more information_

1. Create your own rendition of an artistic piece using _at least_ ```ellipse```, ```rect```, ```line``` as your shapes.

  * For example, if you were using using circles to recreate the Mona Lisa, you could do something like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/08/59/bf/0859bf1ea923f8097e6f7f1af937b1d4--paper-mosaic-mona-lisa.jpg) or [this](http://www.risasinmas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/La-Mona-Lisa-hecha-con-puntos.jpg).
