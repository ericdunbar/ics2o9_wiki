## Task(s)

Your program can be anything you choose (game, artwork etc) as long as you cover all of the necessary concepts.
 
1. Your program should include the following:
* Anything you'd like to re-assess from Assignment 1
* Loops (FOR and WHILE)

2. You are _encouraged_ to practice the following (AP) skills:
* Arrays (FloatList, StringList etc)
* Functions (with parameters and returns)
* Implement an **algorithm** that contains **two or more algorithms**
* Think about an **abstraction** that you've used - perhaps a function that lets you focus on more important things
* Think about the **incremental** process (adding pieces one at a time) and the **iterative** process (repeating/refining what you have) that you've gone through
* Collaborate with a partner.  If you choose to do this, make sure that both of you understand _everything_ in the program, and that it is clear which sections each partner was responsible for

This assignment will be evaluated with an interview.  You will also be asked about (but not evaluated on) the points under #2.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.

You will be assessed on the following **new** Success Criteria, **as well as** any improvements needed from the previous assignment.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can identify situations in which looping structures are required | | | |


| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can write a program that includes looping structures.  | | | |
| I can demonstrate the ability to validate and test a computer program using specific cases, including corner cases | | | |
