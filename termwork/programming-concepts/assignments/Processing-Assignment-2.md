## Task(s)

Your program can be anything you choose (game, artwork etc) as long as you cover all of the necessary concepts.
 
1. Your program should include the following:
* Anything you'd like to re-assess from Assignment 1
* Loops (FOR and WHILE)
* A _simulation_ of a real world event (for example, a coin flip - can't use)

2. You are _encouraged_ to practice the following (AP) skills:
* Arrays
* Functions (with parameters and returns)

This assignment will be evaluated with an interview.  You will also be asked about any **algorithms** and **abstractions** you used for (AP practice).

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.

You will be assessed on the following **new** Success Criteria, **as well as** any improvements needed from the previous assignment.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can identify situations in which looping structures are required | | | |


| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can write a program that includes looping structures.  | | | |
| I can demonstrate the ability to validate and test a computer program using specific cases, including corner cases | | | |
