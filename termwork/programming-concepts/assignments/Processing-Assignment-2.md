## Task(s)

1. Create a program that demonstrates all of your knowledge of Processing up to this point.  Your program can be anything you choose (game, artwork, etc.) as long as you cover all of the necessary concepts.

### Task Criteria

1. Submit a short description of what you plan on making **BEFORE** you start coding.  You can deviate slightly from this, but you are not to submit something completely different without consulting your teacher.
2. Ensure that you demonstrate all of your Processing knowledge from [Assignment 1](./Processing-Assignment-1), as well as _looping structures_ (FOR and WHILE).


## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.

You will be assessed on the following **new** Success Criteria, **as well as** any improvements needed from the previous assignment.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can identify situations in which looping structures are required | | | |


| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can write a program that includes looping structures.  | | | |
| I can demonstrate the ability to validate and test a computer program using specific cases, including corner cases | | | |
