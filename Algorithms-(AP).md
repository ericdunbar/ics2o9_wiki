An _algorithm_ is a set of instructions used to solve a problem.  You use algorithms every day, for example:

`Getting Ready for School`

`1. Wake Up`

`2. Eat Breakfast`

`3. Brush Teeth`

`4. Get Dressed`

`etc`

Algorithms can be expressed in plain language (like above), flow charts (later!) or pseudocode (code intended to be read by humans and not computers).

There are three main components of algorithms:

**Sequencing**

This refers to the fact that the steps need to be completed in that order (top to bottom).  It wouldn't make sense to `Brush Teeth` before `Wake Up`.

**Selection**

Perhaps something should only happen IF a condition is met.  For example:

`Getting Ready for School`

`1. Wake Up`

`2. I am hungry:`

     `Eat Breakfast`

`2. Eat Breakfast`
